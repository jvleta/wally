# WALLY

The goal for Wally is to create a suite of tools for solving a coupled system of equations. 

Key features include:
- Solving equations in a single spatial dimension (through wall thickness).
- Application to cylinders under internal pressure subjected to thermal fluctuations.
- Ability to specify time-dependent boundary conditions to solve for transient temperature and stress distributions.
